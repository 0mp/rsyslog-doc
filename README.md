Documentation for the rsyslog project

This is a work in progress. We are currently migrating over to a new document
generation framework. This will be done in stages starting at the lowest used
version of Rsyslog and then moving up as we go.

Current Status -
* **_v5-stable_**
* v7-stable
* v7-devel
* v8-devel
