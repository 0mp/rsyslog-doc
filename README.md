rsyslog-docs (v7-stable)
========================

Documentation for the rsyslog project
-------------------------------------

This is a work in progress. We are currently migrating over to a new document
generation framework.

The process of this work will be done as follows:

1. Complete v5-stable documentation
2. Merge v5-stable into v7-stable branch
3. Update v7-stable branch with all new documentation and materials specific for that version
4. Repeat 2 and 3 merging current repo with next highest until Master is merged and updated.

Current Status -
* v5-stable - (In Development)
* **_v7-stable_** - (In Development)
* v7-devel - (In Development)
* v8-devel - (In Development)
