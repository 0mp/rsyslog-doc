Parser Modules
--------------

Parser modules are used to parse message content, once the message has
been received. They can be used to process custom message formats or
invalidly formatted messages. For details, please see the :doc:`rsyslog
message parser documentation <../messageparser>`.

The current modules are currently provided as part of rsyslog:

.. toctree::
   :glob:

   pm*
