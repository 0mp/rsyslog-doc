Kernel Log Input Module
=======================

**Module Name:    imklog**

**Author:**\ Rainer Gerhards <rgerhards@adiscon.com>

**Description**:

Reads messages from the kernel log and submits them to the syslog
engine.

**Configuration Directives**:

-  **LogPath**
    The path to the Kernel log. This value should only be changed if you
   really know what you are doing.
-  **InternalMsgFacility <facility>**
    The facility which messages internally generated by imklog will
   have. imklog generates some messages of itself (e.g. on problems,
   startup and shutdown) and these do not stem from the kernel.
   Historically, under Linux, these too have "kern" facility. Thus, on
   Linux platforms the default is "kern" while on others it is
   "syslogd". You usually do not need to specify this configuration
   directive - it is included primarily for few limited cases where it
   is needed for good reason. Bottom line: if you don't have a good idea
   why you should use this setting, do not touch it.
-  **PermitNonKernelFacility [on/*off*]**
    At least under BSD the kernel log may contain entries with
   non-kernel facilities. This setting controls how those are handled.
   The default is "off", in which case these messages are ignored.
   Switch it to on to submit non-kernel messages to rsyslog processing.
-  **ParseKernelTimeStamp** [on/**off**]
    If enabled and the kernel creates a timestamp for its log messages,
   this timestamp will be parsed and converted into regular message time
   instead to use the receive time of the kernel message (as in 5.8.x
   and before). Default is to not parse the kernel timestamp, because
   the clock used by the kernel to create the timestamps is not supposed
   to be as accurate as the monotonic clock required to convert it.
   Depending on the hardware and kernel, it can result in message time
   differences between kernel and system messages which occurred at same
   time.
-  **KeepKernelTimeStamp** [on/**off**]
    If enabled, this option causes to keep the [timestamp] provided by
   the kernel at the begin of in each message rather than to remove it,
   when it could be parsed and converted into local time for use as
   regular message time. Only used when **ParseKernelTimestamp** is on.
-  **ConsoleLogLevel** [*number*\ ] (former klogd -c option) -- sets the
   console log level. If specified, only messages with up to the
   specified level are printed to the console. The default is -1, which
   means that the current settings are not modified. To get this
   behavior, do not specify ConsoleLogLevel in the configuration file.
   Note that this is a global parameter. Each time it is changed, the
   previous definition is re-set. The one activate will be that one that
   is active when imklog actually starts processing. In short words: do
   not specify this directive more than once!

**Caveats/Known Bugs:**

This is obviously platform specific and requires platform drivers.
Currently, imklog functionality is available on Linux and BSD.

This module is **not supported on Solaris** and not needed there. For
Solaris kernel input, use `imsolaris <imsolaris.html>`_.

**Sample:**

The following sample pulls messages from the kernel log. All parameters
are left by default, which is usually a good idea. Please note that
loading the plugin is sufficient to activate it. No directive is needed
to start pulling kernel messages.

module(load="imklog")

**Legacy Configuration Directives**:

-  **$KLogInternalMsgFacility <facility>**
    equivalent to: InternalMsgFacility
-  $KLogPermitNonKernelFacility [on/off]
    equivalent to: PermitNonKernelFacility
-  $DebugPrintKernelSymbols [on/**off**]
    Linux only, ignored on other platforms (but may be specified)
-  **$klogLocalIPIF** [interface name] - (available since 5.9.6) - if
   provided, the IP of the specified interface (e.g. "eth0") shall be
   used as fromhost-ip for imklog-originating messages. If this
   directive is not given OR the interface cannot be found (or has no IP
   address), the default of "127.0.0.1" is used.
-  $klogSymbolLookup [on/**off**] -- disables imklog kernel symbol
   translation (former klogd -x option). NOTE that this option is
   counter-productive on recent kernels (>= 2.6) because the kernel
   already does the symbol translation and this option breaks the
   information.
    **This option is scheduled for removal, probably with version 4.x.**
   Do not use it except if you have a very good reason. If you have one,
   let us know because otherwise new versions will no longer support it.
    Linux only, ignored on other platforms (but may be specified)
-  **$klogConsoleLogLevel** [*number*\ ]
   equivalent to: ConsoleLogLevel
-  **$klogUseSyscallInterface** [on/**off**] -- former klogd -s option
    Linux only, ignored on other platforms (but may be specified)
-  $klogSymbolsTwice [on/**off**] -- former klogd -2 option
    Linux only, ignored on other platforms (but may be specified)
-  **$klogParseKernelTimeStamp** [on/**off**]
    equivalent to: ParseKernelTimeStamp
-  **$klogKeepKernelTimeStamp** [on/**off**]
    equivalent to: KeepKernelTimeStamp
