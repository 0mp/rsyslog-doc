Welcome to rsyslog
==================

Rsyslog is an enhanced syslogd suitable both for small systems as well 
as large enterprises.

In general, rsyslog supports plain old syslog.conf format, except that
the config file is now called rsyslog.conf. This should help you get
started quickly. To do the really cool things, though, you need to learn
a bit about its new features. When you change the configuration, remember 
to restart rsyslogd, because otherwise it will not use your new settings 
(and you'll end up totally puzzled why this great config of yours does 
not even work a bit...;))
