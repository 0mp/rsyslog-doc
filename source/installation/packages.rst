rsyslog packages
================

**Thanks to some volunteers, rsyslog is also available in package form
on some distributions.** All currently known packages are listed below.
If I have forgotten one or if you would like to maintain a package for a
new distribution, please mail me at
`rgerhards@adiscon.com <mailto:rgerhards@adiscon.com>`_. Any help is
\*deeply\* appreciated. While I create the core daemon, the package
maintainers are really filling it with life, making it available to the
average user. I am very grateful for that!

This list has last been updated on 2008-07-11 by `Rainer

packages may appear at any time, so be sure to check this page whenever
you need a new one.

      distribution.

-  **Ubuntu**

   -  Starting with hardy, rsyslog is available from the universe
      repository.

-  Almost any Linux

   -  Bennet Todd maintains packages that should work on almost any
      Linux. He keeps a current i386 tree. There is also a PPC tree, but
      that one is not paid much attention for (anyhow, it is known to
      typically work well, too). Please visit
      `http://bent.latency.net/bent/ <http://bent.latency.net/bent/>`_,
      select the relevant tree and then do a search for rsyslog. Please
      note, however, that as of this writing the versions in this
      repository have been aged a bit. So it may be worth trying to find
      some other places first.

Just in case you are interested, the list of distribution is sorted by
alphabetic order of the distribution name.

If you do not find a suitable package for your distribution, there is no
reason to panic. It is quite simple to install rsyslog from the source
tarball, so you should consider that.
