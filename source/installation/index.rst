Installation
============

In most cases, people install rsyslog either via a package or use an
"official" distribution tarball to generate it. But there may be
situations where it is desirable to build directly from the source
repository. This is useful for people who would like to participate in
development or who would like to use the latest, not-yet-released code.
The latter may especially be the case if you are asked to try out an
experimental version.
